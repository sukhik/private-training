Please be sure your player has upwards of two bottles of water during summer training. 

Player needs cleats, flat shoes such as tennis shoes, indoor, or cross-training shoes, and slides to change into/from before reaching the field.

Player should be wearing long socks with cleats with or without shingaurds.

A spare pair of regulation socks, shingaurds, and athletic tape or pre-wrap if your player has used it before should be in the bag.

## See you at the field!
