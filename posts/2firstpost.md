Hey Parents, Players:

As the summmer session comes to a close I wanted to congratulate you on your hard work. The progress we have met on the field and off is astonishing and I see your futures are quite bright. I want you to sustain your progress even after summer ends. Don't lose your progress, just keep it up every day. Keep practicing at home, and keep practicing as school starts up again. Y'all can do it!

Sukhi
