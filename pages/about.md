Woman owned, woman trained private soccer experience for competitive players.

## Our services

Even in private lessons, the thrust is on teamwork, the sport, fair play, and the beauty of the game. 

We focus heavily on physical conditioning and development, agility, and injury prevention.

Our specialities are conditioning, training in the fundamentals, and the female athlete.

## Our Trainer

Sukhi Grewal played on the Warriors, Lonestars, and Rangers, as well as for Westwood High School until 2007. At the intramural level, Sukhi played in college at UCSB. At the club level, Sukhi spent graduate years playing at Berkeley. In 2018, Sukhi began picking up at Zilker and guest playing with Austin Women's League as well as with co-ed adult leagues and FC's. She loves world cup and watches international games throughout the seasons. Beyond a spectator, Sukhi's first job was refereeing soccer matches after getting registered and licensed through the Texas State Soccer Association when she was 10. She's now a multisport athlete, so if she isn't playing, watching, or training soccer, she's running, swimming, or practicing yoga.

Over the last 20 years, Sukhi coped with chronic ankle sprains, ACL tears and other knee injuries, as well as tendon, ligament and muscle strains. Sukhi has seen it all, the full spectrum of experiences in the world of soccer and select soccer: tryouts, teams, coaches, players, parents. The signal among the noise for her is the individual. She is dedicated to developing excellent players with winning attitudes and high levels of fitness. She is dedicated to developing young players, and using the sport and game as a way to learn while building character and identity.

## The Value

These are the best prices for professional athletic development for your player. We also use the latest methods available and we're up to date on research relevant to the player and the game.

## The Location

Our lessons are local. We utilize publicly owned parks and fields. In 2021, while we will have a modest private facility and field, we will continue using local and city resources for cross-training, field trips, and scrimmages.
