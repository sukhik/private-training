Woman owned, woman trained private soccer experience for competitive players.

## Our services

Even in private lessons, the thrust is on teamwork, the sport, fair play, and the beauty of the game. 

We focus heavily on physical conditioning and development, agility, and injury prevention.

Our specialities are fundamentals and the female athlete.

## Our Trainer

Sukhi Grewal played on the Warriors, Lonestars, and Rangers, as well as for Westwood High School until 2007. At the intramural level, Sukhi played in college at UCSB. At the club level, Sukhi spent her graduate years playing at Berkeley. In 2018, Sukhi began picking up at Zilker and guest played with Austin Women's League as well as with co-ed adult leagues and FC's. She loves watching the men's and women's world cup as well as international games throughout the seasons. Beyond spectating, Sukhi's first job was refereeing soccer matches after getting registered and licensed through the Texas State Soccer Association in the early 2000's. She's now a multisport athlete, so if she isn't playing, watching, or training soccer, she's running, swimming, or practicing yoga.

Over the last 20 years, Sukhi coped with chronic ankle sprains, ACL tears and other knee injuries, as well as tendon, ligament and muscle strains. Sukhi has seen it all, the full spectrum of experiences in the world of soccer and select soccer: tryouts, teams, coaches, players. The signal among the noise, for Sukhi, is the individual. She is dedicated to developing excellent players with winning attitudes. She is dedicated to developing the young players, and using the sport and game of soccer as a way to learn and enjoy life.

## The Value

These are the best prices for professional athletic development for your player. We also use the latest methods available and we're up to date on research relevant to the player and the game.

## The Location

Our lessons are local. We utilize publicly owned parks and fields. In 2021, while we will have a modest private facility and field, we will continue using local and city resources for cross-training, field trips, and scrimmages.
